# Code of Conduct

## 1. Purpose

The Large Language Model Programming (LLMP) community is dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for
everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical
appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, nationality, religion, or technical ability. We do not tolerate harassment of
participants in any form.

This code of conduct outlines our expectations for all those who participate in our community, as well as the
consequences for unacceptable behavior.

## 2. Expected Behavior

- Participate in an authentic and active way.
- Exercise consideration and respect in your speech and actions.
- Attempt collaboration before conflict.
- Refrain from demeaning, discriminatory, or harassing behavior and speech.
- Be mindful of your surroundings and of your fellow participants.
- Alert community leaders if you notice a dangerous situation, someone in distress, or violations of this Code of
  Conduct.

## 3. Unacceptable Behavior

Unacceptable behaviors include:

- Harassment, intimidation, or discrimination in any form.
- Verbal comments that reinforce social structures of domination.
- Inappropriate or unwelcome attention or contact.
- Not respecting the privacy of others; e.g., stalking, following, or persistent messaging.
- Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic address, without permission.
- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting.

## 4. Consequences of Unacceptable Behavior

Unacceptable behavior from any community member will not be tolerated. Anyone asked to stop unacceptable behavior is
expected to comply immediately.

If a community member engages in unacceptable behavior, the community organizers may take any action they deem
appropriate, up to and including a temporary ban or permanent expulsion from the community without warning.

## 5. Reporting Guidelines

If you are subject to or witness unacceptable behavior, or have any other concerns, please notify a community organizer
as soon as possible. You can report it directly via email or any other official communication channels established by
the LLMP community.

## 6. Addressing Grievances

If you feel you have been falsely or unfairly accused of violating this Code of Conduct, you should notify the project
maintainers. They will assess and decide on an appropriate response.

## 7. Scope

This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces when an individual is representing the
project or its community.
